# termux-configurer
some people are lazy to install packages after downloading termux to a new device or after doing termux-reset. Configurer can do it automatically and you can add more packages you want to install.
# starting
type:
pkg update
pkg install git
git clone https://github.com/SergSel2006/termux-configurer
cd termux-configurer
bash install.sh
that's all.
