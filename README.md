# termux-configurer
some people are lazy to install packages after downloading termux to a new device or after doing termux-reset. Configurer can do it automatically and you can add more packages you want to install.
# starting
type:
1.`pkg update`
2.`pkg install git`
3.`git clone https://github.com/SergSel2006/termux-configurer`
4.`cd termux-configurer`
5.`bash install.sh`
that's all.
